# techdegree-project-4

I am striving for an "exceeds expectations" evaluation.

I have added the required physical keyboard functionality as you can see.

I have made the project my own by sliding the overlay down at the end to show the game over message.  
  Also, I changed the overlay to update the background color based on the outcome.

  Thanks!
